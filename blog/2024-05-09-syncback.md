I am here to announce a new feature for Rojo that we are calling 'syncback'!

Syncback is designed to solve the longstanding problem of converting a Roblox file (like a `.rbxl`) into a Rojo project. It replaces [`rbxlx-to-rojo`][rbxlx-to-rojo] in this respect. This blog will go into what it does, how to use it, and a quick overview of how it works.

[rbxlx-to-rojo]: https://github.com/rojo-rbx/rbxlx-to-rojo

## What Does It Do?

As mentioned previously, syncback converts Roblox files into a Rojo project. What this means in practice is that syncback will take a Roblox file, iterate through it, and then create a bunch of files that will recreate that Roblox project when synced with Rojo. Unlike `rbxlx-to-rojo`, syncback covers all Instances in a file. This means that if syncback is run over a place file, you should be able to use `rojo build` on the project and get something that is identical.

Syncback also does something that's new for Rojo: it handles 'reference' properties like `Model.PrimaryPart`, even across files. Prior to work starting on syncback, this was something that we'd mostly ignored. Reference properties worked within `.rbxm` and `.rbxmx` files, but doing it across files was simply not something we actually supported. So you couldn't, as an example, have a `.model.json` file that pointed to another `.model.json` file.

This has changed now though, and reference properties are supported. This is a feature that's separate from syncback, so it won't be covered here in full. The important part is that syncback will preserve reference properties when running.

## How Do I Use It?

Counterintuitively, syncback requires a `.project.json` file. This is actually how you control it! When iterating through a file, it'll only handle Instances that are descendants of an Instance defined by the project. This means that in order to e.g. include `Workspace` in syncback, there needs to be a node in your project file representing `Workspace`.

To give a proper example, let's imagine you have a project file like this:

```json
{
    "name": "example project",
    "tree": {
        "$className": "DataModel",
        "ReplicatedStorage": {
            "$path": "src/ReplicatedStorage"
        }
    }
}
```

If you were to run syncback over top of that project, only things that were a descendant of `ReplicatedStorage` would be included. Additionally, since `$path` points to a directory, syncback would put children of `ReplicatedStorage` into that directory.

To run syncback, simply use `rojo syncback --input path/to/file.rbxl [path/to/project]` in your terminal, where `--input` is the path to the Roblox file you want to convert and `[path/to/project]` is a path a project you're using as the output. If the folder you're in includes a `default.project.json`, you don't need to provide `[path/to/project]`.

If you need help with this, remember to try running `rojo help syncback` in your terminal or simply ask someone for help.
